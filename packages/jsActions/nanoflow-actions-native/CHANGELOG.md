### Breaking

-   iOS: We changed the library that uses [android.location API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/package-summary), to the new library that uses the [Google Location Services API](https://developer.android.com/training/location/). Regarding this change, you should use `Request location permission` action before using `Get current location` and `Get current location with minimum accuracy` action.
