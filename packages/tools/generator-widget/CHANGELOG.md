- Explains users in the README of generated widget project how to install dependencies with NPM v7.x.x.
- Set required Node.js version to v12 or higher for the generator itself and the generated widget projects, since Node.js v10 is EOL at the end of April 2021 and pluggable widgets tools requires Node.js v12.
