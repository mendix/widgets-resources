## [Unreleased]

## 1.2.0 - Unreleased

### Added
- We implemented lazy filtering and sorting. Now Data Grid v2 will not load all the data if you have sorting or filtering enabled.
- We added an option to auto-load values from enumerations in the Data Grid drop-down filter.

### Changed
- We fixed a problem combining a Text Box widget inside a column with an on leave or on change event preventing focus from being lost after triggering the events.
- We fixed an issue with headers containing attributes in the text template.
- We prevented settings' on change action to be fired continuously while resizing a column, causing performance issues.
- We prevented the settings from being overwritten when loading a new value from the settings attribute.
