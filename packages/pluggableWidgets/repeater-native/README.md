Iterates over a data source or nanoflow and repeats the content changing the values assigned to it.

## How to use
- Place your widget in a native page
- Select a data source or nanoflow in the data source property
- Add constraints if necessary
- You can add an action in the subsequent property. This action will be executed for each pressed item. The nanoflow or page assigned to this action will receive the context object referred in the rendered item.
