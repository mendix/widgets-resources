## PopupMenu

Use pop up menu to create a menus which anchored to an element. Pop up menu will be opened after pressing to the anchor element and close when one of the items are clicked.

## Usage

### Adding triggerer

Simply fill the content of the triggerer. This is a free modeling content and will be wrapped by touchable. **Any touchable items (buttons, dropdowns etc..) in this field will steal the touch event and it will prevent popup menu to open.**

### Adding menu items

For the sake of simplicity, there are two modes available to add new items to popup menu:

#### Simple mode

Simply add new item with Caption and Action to quickly create a dropdown item. Selecting divider will add a divider with straight line.

#### Advanced mode

Every item which has the advanced mode selected, adds free modeling area. Every item will be wrapped by a Touchable. **Any touchable items (buttons, dropdowns etc..) in this field will steal the touch event and it will prevent popup menu to close**.

If you wish to achieve tooltip like behaviour this can be best achieved by this mode.
