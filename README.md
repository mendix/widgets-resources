## Documentation

Please visit the [Mendix Docs](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/native-mobile) for more information on building native
mobile apps.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mendix/widgets-resources/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Developing

-   `npm install` on root

### For developing native widgets in `packages/pluggableWidgets`:

-   Create a simple Mendix project in Studio
-   Copy all of it's contents to `packages-native/test-project`.
-   Run `npm run build` on a desired widget folder. For ex: `packages/pluggableWidgets/badge-native/`. This will build and copy the mpk
    to the test-project's correct widget folder.
-   Open and run the project in `packages-native/test-project` with Mendix Studio

### For developing web widgets in `packages/pluggableWidgets`:

-   Mendix projects for each widget already comes with repo with folder called
    `packages/pluggableWidgets/<widgetName>/tests/testProject`. If you do not see the corresponding folder, run
    `git submodule init && git submodule update`.
-   Run `npm run pretest:e2e` to initialize Mendix project.
-   Run `npm run build` on a desired widget folder. For ex: `packages/pluggableWidgets/badge-web`. This will build and copy the mpk to
    each Mendix project's correct widget folder.
-   Open and run the project in `<widgetName>/tests/testProject` with Mendix Studio

#### Adding new test project to the repo

-   Go to `https://github.com/mendix/testProjects` and create a appropriate branch name from master
-   Add your **.mpr** files, commit and push (remember your branch name)
-   Go to `widgets-resources` monorepo and in root folder execute `git submodule add -b your-branch-name-of-testprojects https://github.com/mendix/testProjects.git /necessary-folder-names/tests/testProject`

Note: Do not manually change the `.gitmodules` since this wont work when adding new submodules.

### For developing in `packages/jsActions`:

-   Create a simple Mendix project in Studio.
-   Copy all of it's contents to `packages/jsActions/nanoflow-commons/dist/mxproject`.
-   Run `npm run build` on `nanoflow-commons`. This will build and copy the mpk to dist/mxproject's
    correct folder.

Please bear in mind that when you develop JSActions, creation process is not automatically picked up by Modeler. Which
means:

-   First you have to create the ts file in `nanoflow-commons/src/.../ExampleName.ts` with desired content. Please take
    a look at examples in `src/client`.
-   Second you have to create a JsAction with name `ExampleName` and `parameters` in Studio.
-   Then every time `npm run build` is run, the code piece between `// BEGIN USER CODE` and `// END USER CODE` will be
    changed. After you close and open the JSAction in Studiom changes will be picked up automatically.

## Releasing Native Mobile Resources

-   Bump the version of the necessary widget by running `npm run version your-widget-name desired-version`
-   Create draft tag in github repo which will also create release mpk for the necessary widget `npm run publish your-widget-name`
-   Add notes to your draft
-   Update the necessary widgets to the Mendix `Native Mobile Resources` app and push the changes
-   Export the module, include every dependency
-   Create a manual tag for the exported module "Native Mobile Resources - AppStore release vx.x.x" and add the Exported Module as asset

## Commiting submodules

-   Change the test project
-   Commit and push the test project in testProjects' corresponding branch
-   Go back to monorepo, commit the shown testProjects change and push
