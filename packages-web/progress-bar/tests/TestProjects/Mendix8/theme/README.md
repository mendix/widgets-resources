# Mendix Atlas UI

Mendix Atlas UI is the foundation of making beautiful apps with Mendix. For more information about the framework go
[here](https://atlas.mendix.com/).

### Theme folder structure

The theme folder contains the default HTML pages, Sass, CSS and resources needed to style your application.

#### Workflow

In the Sass folder you will notice two main folders, custom and lib. The lib folder houses the complete Mendix UI
Framework. The custom folder is where we recommend doing _all customizations_. This will making updating to the new
framework easier.

##### Structure

Mendix is capable of creating beautiful and user-friendly UI. Our Atlas UI framework demonstrates some of its
possibilities. Here you will find a basic overview of our framework.

###### Base

The base folder contains the _architecture_ for our framework. Here you will find our _mixins_ and _resets_.

###### Components

This directory contains the styling of all kinds of basic components like the datagrid, buttons, label, form, listview,
and anything along those lines. They have distinct properties and can't be broken down further without losing their
meaning.

###### Custom Widgets

This directory contains any extra styling that might be needed for custom widgets downloaded from the Mendix App Store.

###### Building Blocks

Building blocks are made up of components and widgets. For example _cards_ or _headers_ are building blocks. A building
block could be an image, a title, and a button, assembled together into one UI block.

###### Layouts

The layout directory contains some styles for the main sections of the layout (topbar, sidebar, footer and so on).

###### Variable.scss

This file contains the style settings that are used across the project, allowing for consistent typography, color
schemes, etc.
