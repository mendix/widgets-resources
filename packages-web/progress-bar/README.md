# Progress bar
Displays a progress bar

## Features
* Show percentage of progress based on value
* Render bar types: plain, striped or animated stripes
* Bar bootstrap colors: success, info, warning or danger

## Dependencies
Mendix 7.1

## Demo project
https://progressbar-demo.mxapps.io/

## Usage
Place the widget in the context of an object that has attributes for value and maximum value.

Progress percentage is calculated as follows:

    (value / maximumValue) * 100

If the maximum value attribute is not set, maximum value defaults to 100.

Depending on the specified bootstrap style (primary, success, info, warning, danger), the progress bar can appear in the associated colors.

For negative progress values, the bar is drawn from right to left.
