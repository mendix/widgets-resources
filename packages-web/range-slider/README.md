# Range Slider
Change a range of values using a slider.

## Features
* Adjust lower bound and upper bound values on the slider
* Execute a microflow when a slider value is changed or clicked
* Show or hide a tooltip on hover
* Render range slider with different bootstrap colors

## Dependencies
Mendix 7.1

## Usage
Place the widget in the context of an object that has attributes for maximum value, minimum value, lower bound value and upper bound value

The maximum and minimum values determine the range within which the range slider values can be adjusted.

For the step value, the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value should be divisible by 2. i.e.

    (maximumValue - minimumValue) % 2 = 0
