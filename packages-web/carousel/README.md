# Carousel
Displays images in a carousel.

## Features
* Supports different data sources:
    * Set static images in the Modeler
    * Retrieve images from the database via XPath
    * Retrieve images via a microflow
* Image from mendix System.Images or from a URL
* Navigate to the next or the previous image
* Execute a microflow or open a page when an image is clicked
* Execute a nanoflow or open a page when an image is clicked
* Swipe through the images on mobile devices

## Dependencies
Mendix 7.13.1

## Test project
https://carousel.mxapps.io/

## Usage
The widget requires a context.
 ### Data source: Static
 - On the Data source option of the Data source tab, select the static option if its not already selected by default.
 - On the Static images option of the same tab, click new to add static images from the modeler and also configure an onclick action.
 - For the on click options, configure only one of the two (either calling a microflow or a page).
 - Configuring both options will only trigger the microflow.

 ### Data source: XPath
 - On the Data source option of the Data source tab, select the XPath option.
 - Specify the image entity and the XPath constraint (if any).
 - In the behavior tab, you can configure on click behavior i.e Do nothing, call microflow or show page.
 - For options call microflow and show page, a microflow or page must be specified respectively.

 ### Data source: Microflow
  - On the Data source option of the Data source tab, select the Microflow option.
  - Specify the image entity and the microflow to retrieve the carousel images from (both required).
  - Refer to the XPath section for configuring click behavior.

  For the microflow and XPath data source options, specifying a URL attribute will make the value of the URL attribute the priority.
