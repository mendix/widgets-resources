# Development and contribution
Prerequisite: Install git, node package manager, webpack CLI, grunt CLI, Karma CLI

To contribute, fork and clone.

    > git clone https://github.com/mendixlabs/badge.git

The code is in typescript. Use a typescript IDE of your choice, like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm.

To set up the development environment, run:

    > npm install

Create a folder named `dist` in the project root.

Create a Mendix test project in the dist folder and rename its root folder to `dist/MxTestProject`. Changes to the widget code shall be automatically pushed to this test project.
Or get the test project from [https://github.com/mendixlabs/badge/releases/latest](https://github.com/mendixlabs/badge/releases/latest)

To automatically compile, bundle and push code changes to the running test project, run:

    > npm start

To run the project unit tests with code coverage, results can be found at `dist/testresults/coverage/index.html`, run:

    > npm run test:unit

Run the unit test continuously during development:

    > npm run test:dev

Run the end to end test during development:

    > npm run test:e2e:dev

## Scripts
While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Build the project and monitor source and config for changes and rebuild.|
|`test`|Runs lint, build, unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report, deploy and run e2e test|
|`test:dev`|Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.|
|`test:unit`|Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.|
|`test:e2e`|Runs end 2 end tests with remote.|
|`test:e2e:dev`|Runs end 2 end tests with locally on localhost:8080|
|`deploy`|Use latest widget build to update the Mendix project update the application to Mendix node.|
|`build:prod`|Build widget optimized for production|
|`build:dev`|Build widget optimized for debugging.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|
|`lint:fix`|Lint and fix all `.ts` files.|

# CI and remote testing
To enable the continues integration services.
Copy the `node_modules/mendix-widget-build-script/dist/localSettings.js`
 to your project root, and update the settings to run the update deployment from local source.

**Do not forget** to exclude this file in the `.gitignore` as it contains sensitive data.
```
exports.settings = {
    appName: "appName",
    key: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    password: "secret",
    projectId: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    user: "ci@example.com"
};
```
