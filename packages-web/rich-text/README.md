![Running rich text toolbar widget](/assets/Demo-Toolbar.png)
![Running rich text bubble widget](/assets/Demo-Bubble.png)

## Usage
Place the widget in a data view, list view or template grid with a data source that has a string attribute and select the 'Value attribute' that contains the editable text.

## HTML content
Please note, that the input and output is sanitized. All unsupported HTML tags and JavaScript is removed for security reasons.
Supports:
 * Tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, br, a, ul, li, ol, s, u, em, pre, strong, blockquote, span
 * Attributes:
   * for all tags: class, style
   * `a` tag: href, name, target
 * Schemes: http, https, ftp, mailto

**Please note**: To be fully secure, all user HTML input should be sanitized on the server side too. This could be done with the `XSSSanitize` action found in the Community Commons https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/170/
When the option 'Sanitize content' is set to 'false' server side sanitating is required before showing any HTML content.
