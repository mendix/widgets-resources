# Mendix UI Framework

This is the library for the Mendix UI Framework to quickly create a beautiful app with Mendix. This library acts as a
submodule for the default Mendix themes that can be found [here](https://ux.mendix.com/).

### Theme folder structure

The theme folder consists of the default HTML pages, Sass, CSS and resources needed to style your application.

#### Styles / Sass

In the Sass folder you will notice two main folders, custom and library. The library folder houses the complete Mendix
UI Framework and the custom folder is a duplication of the library folder. We advice to do _all customization_ in the
custom folder.

##### Library Folder

We created a framework so our users have a clear understanding what Mendix is capable of. The library folder structure
is as follows:

-   Base
-   Building Blocks
-   Components
-   Layouts
-   Mobile

###### Base

The base folder holds the _architecture_ for our framework. Here we have our _mixins_, _variables_ and _resets_. The
variables is what makes our framework, which holds all global variables for the project (for typography, color schemes,
and so on).

###### Components

This directory contains all kind of basic components like a datagrid, buttons, label, form, listview, or anything along
those lines. They have distinct properties and can't be broken down further without losing their meaning.

###### Building Blocks

Building blocks are combined components/widgets. For example _cards_ or _headers_ are building blocks. A building block
could be an image, title and a button built together.

###### Layouts

The layout directory contains some styles for the main sections of the layout (topbar, sidebar, footer and so on).

###### Mobile

The mobile directory include specific styling for your tablet or phone pages and widgets. This is useful to target only
mobile use cases.
