## Dependencies

The actions are dependent on cordova phonegap plugins. Most dependencies are already provided in the standard template.
When building your [Hybrid mobile apps](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp) Please make sure you
add and enabled the decencies by:

Enabling in the `Permissions` by selecting:

-   Calendar
-   Camera
-   Photo Library
-   Contacts

And add to the `Custom Phonegap/Cordova configuration` the following snippet.

```xml
    <plugin name="cordova-plugin-android-fingerprint-auth" source="npm" spec="1.5.0" />
    <plugin name="cordova-plugin-touch-id" source="npm" spec="3.4.0" />
    <plugin name="cordova-clipboard" source="npm" spec="1.3.0" />
```

Please note that the above plugins are not available in the in standard
[Mendix Mobile app](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/getting-the-mendix-app) and can only be test with a
[custom build app](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mobileapp).

These configurations can also be set when
[building a custom phonegap package](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/customizing-phonegap-build-packages#1-introduction).
